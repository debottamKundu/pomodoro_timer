# Pomodoro Timer

The **Pomodoro Technique** is a time management technique developed by Francesco Cirillio. It invloves using a timer to break down your work time into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, wtih 5 minute breaks in between. It is recommended to take a longer break after 4 such cycles. 

The package is fairly simple and involves a default setting of 25 minutes of work, 5 minutes of break and 4 such alternating cycles before the timer resets. You can change the timing intervals or the number of cycles from the package settings.

You can start and stop the timers from the command pallate, or use the shortcut `Ctrl+Alt+P` to start the clock and `Ctrl+Alt+R` to reset it.

Let me know if you have any features that you would like to be added.
